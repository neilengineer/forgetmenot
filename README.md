It's very dangerous to forgot/leave your kids in car on a hot day. With this forgetmenot smart device under your kids' car seat mat, you'll get alarm with sound and vibration on your phone.

<b>How does it work?</b>
1) Forgetmenot is a device using Arduino + Bluetooth + proper software on both Arduino and your smart phone.
2) When kids sat on it, a button will be pressed and turn on; otherwise unpressed. If it's turned on, the device will continuously send packets over bluetooth to your paired smartphone.
3) Phone will alarm if you leave the car with your smart phone, but kids forgot in car.
